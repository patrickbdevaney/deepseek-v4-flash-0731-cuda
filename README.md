# deepseek-v4-flash-0731-cuda

A from-scratch pure-CUDA inference server for **`0xSero/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731-REAP`** (K160, native
MXFP4) with embedded **DSpark** self-speculative decoding, MLA + DSA attention, hand-tuned for
**Jetson AGX Thor, `sm_110a`**.

No Python on the hot path. Every kernel gated against a PyTorch oracle before it is trusted.

> ## Why
>
> **Local frontier-adjacent intelligence, on hardware you own, fast enough to do long-horizon
> agentic work unattended.** Neither half is rare alone — frontier capability is available through
> an API, fast local decode is available on small models. **Both at once, on one box, with no
> network in the loop, is not.**
>
> The four categories this engine runs *fastest* — long context 30.77, tool/JSON format 29.98,
> multi-turn 28.97, code edit 26.81 tok/s — are precisely the shapes agentic coding produces.
> Speculation pays where continuation is constrained, and agentic work is constrained by definition.
>
> **Every gain here is lossless**: emitted tokens identical to base AR, checked on every run. That
> invariant is what keeps "fast" and "frontier" from becoming a trade.
>
> **[`NORTH_STAR.md`](NORTH_STAR.md)** — the full argument, including the one number in it that is
> still inherited rather than measured.

## Where the programme is (2026-08-22)

The work runs as **four phases**, in this order, on one box that can hold **one model at a time**.
Full text and per-phase gates: [`PRODUCTION_PLAN.md`](PRODUCTION_PLAN.md).

| phase | what it is | state |
|---|---|---|
| **1. draft head + spec decode** | exhaust every acceptance lever before measuring anything | **in flight** — P2.5 landed (+4.13 %), P2.6 running, 2.3 not started |
| **2. prefill to the roofline** | 62.4 tok/s and ~3.3 min TTFT at 12 k is the largest remaining gap in the system | not started |
| **3. prefix caching** | prove the OpenAI-compatible server is usable by a real agentic harness | not started |
| **4. the eval battery** | run **once**, at the final configuration | armed, deliberately not started |

**The eval battery is suspended mid-flight and stays that way until phase 3 closes.** That is a
decision, not a stall: the battery is idempotent and resumptive, it costs ~3 days of GPU, and every
day of phase 1–3 makes those 3 days cheaper and the resulting numbers more representative of what
actually ships. Resume with `bash scripts/eval_resume.sh`; full state in
[`evidence/evals/SUSPENDED.md`](evidence/evals/SUSPENDED.md). `dsv4-evalstage.service` exists and is
**deliberately disarmed** so nothing starts it by accident.

**One rule the battery inherits from this suspension:** accuracy rows pool across engine revisions,
throughput rows do not. `tools/stamp_eval_provenance.py` records head, block width and engine rev at
every battery start, and `tools/eval_publish.py` prints that block next to the results, so a reader
can see which rows are poolable.

### Where each row actually stands

| task | row | n | acc | trunc | state |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| math500 | low | 100 | 95.0 | 1.0 % | **quotable** |
| humaneval | low | 164 | 95.1 | 3.7 % | **quotable** |
| bfcl | low | 240 | 86.2 | 1.2 % | **quotable** |
| bfcl_live | low | 508 | 78.7 | 1.0 % | **quotable** |
| aime24 | low24k | 60 | 91.7 | 10.0 % | extended and landed; **over the 5 % gate → needs forcing** |
| mmlu_pro | low24k | 141/150 | *76.6* | *1.4 %* | ⚠️ **extension partial** |
| gpqa_diamond | low24k | 147/198 | *93.9* | *0.0 %* | ⚠️ **extension partial** |
| aime25 | low24k | 45/60 | *96.2* | *2.2 %* | ⚠️ **extension partial** — suspended cleanly after item 6/21 |
| scicode | low | 291 | 30.2 | 18.6 % | extension not started |
| lcb | low | 175 | 46.9 | **59.4 %** | extension not started |

> **The three italicised rows are NOT partial results — they are biased ones, and must not be
> quoted.** An extension writes the traces that *terminated* first and continues the truncated ones
> one at a time, so a partial file contains a disproportionate share of the easy half. GPQA reading
> 93.9 % at 0.0 % truncation is that artefact, not a number: its base row is 72.7 % at 25.8 %
> truncated. `tools/eval_ext_complete.py` is the oracle both the retry and forcing stages ask, and
> `tools/stage_top.py` shows the same thing live.

**On resume**, `eval_extend_retry.sh` finishes the three partial files first, then the sweep reaches
scicode and lcb, then forcing, then BFCL multi-turn. Nothing needs to be re-done by hand.

## The target: 35–42 tok/s

**22.66 → 28.38 tok/s is banked (+25.3 %). The ladder to 35–42 is written down**, rung by rung,
with what each is worth and what it costs: [`DECODE_ENDGAME.md`](DECODE_ENDGAME.md), full
mechanisms in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).

| # | rung | worth | cost | state |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | **banked**: width 5 + fine-tuned head | 22.66 → **28.38** | done | ✅ |
| 1 | corpus — agentic-weighted, 2× size and depth | +4–9 % est. | wall clock | **running** |
| 2 | remaining arms — anchor shape | +0–2 % | wall clock | capped at 4 |
| 3 | **C(k) sweep**, widths 4–12 | *prices rung 4* | wall clock | **queued** |
| 4 | **adaptive block width** | **+20–25 % est.** | CUDA | gated on rung 3 |
| 5 | AR kernel headroom | +5–10 % est. | CUDA, hard | deferred |
| — | **prefill to the roofline** | **6.6× TTFT** | CUDA | practicality, not throughput |

**The levers already used do not repeat.** Ten draft-head arms at block 5 put their top five within
**1.3 %** of each other against a 3.5 % promotion bar — ce/tv swept three ways, β bracketed on both
sides, HASS and the confidence loss term both retired. At **~13.8 tok/s per unit `tau`**, an
excellent further arm is worth +1.5 tok/s. That is why rung 1 is *data* and rung 4 is
*architecture*.

**Rung 3 is the highest-leverage hour on this machine.** `tau`'s ceiling **is** the draft width, so
at a fixed 5 even a perfect head is worth 1.30× — and perfect is impossible, because acceptance is
bounded by the target's *entropy*, not by our ignorance. Varying the width removes the bound, but
only if the best width differs by task shape, which has never been tested. It needs no kernel. If
k\* varies, rung 4's estimate becomes a measurement; if k\* = 5 everywhere, rung 4 is refuted for
the price of one overnight run instead of a CUDA rewrite.

**Prefill is not on the ladder and may matter more than all of it.** 62.4 tok/s and **~3.3 min TTFT
at 12 k** contribute nothing to tok/s, and a three-minute time-to-first-token makes throughput
academic for an agentic harness.

## Where the numbers are today

| | measured | ceiling | |
|---|---|---|---|
| **speculative decode**, 8-prompt suite mean | **28.38 tok/s** (`s3recap-p25-b0.1`, live) | — | +25.3 % over the stock head this project started from |
| acceptance τ, suite mean | **3.84 / 5** | 5 at block 5 | **77 %** of the width ceiling |
| **base AR decode** | **14.61 tok/s** | 14.33–15.98 | at the realistic floor |
| **prefill (PS=1022)** | **62.4 tok/s** | ≥ 410 target | **the largest gap in the system** — phase 2 |

The shipped speculator is **`s3recap-p25-b0.1`**, promoted at `tau` 3.8413 against a same-width
incumbent of 3.6888. Every candidate, rejects included, is in
[`HEAD_REGISTRY.md`](HEAD_REGISTRY.md) with its weights archived under `~/model-backups/heads/`; the
programme that produced it is [`wiki/draft-head-finetuning.md` §9](wiki/draft-head-finetuning.md).
**Nothing is ever deleted from the archive** — a refused head is still a measured point on the
acceptance curve, and two of this project's rulers turned out to be wrong after the fact.

**τ is not comparable across block widths.** τ counts tokens committed per target forward and its
ceiling *is* the draft width, so 3.84/5 and 3.84/6 are not the same measurement. Ladder 2.1 moved
the served width from 6 to 5 — which is what `config.json`'s own `dspark_block_size` always said —
and that alone re-prices every τ recorded before 2026-08-21. `s3` reads 3.8438 at width 6 and
**3.6888 at width 5, same weights.**

**One caveat that belongs next to the headline.** Trained heads win the frozen suite and can *lose*
on held-out continuation drafting against a true paired control (F116/F117: training helps where the
head is weak and hurts where it is strong). P2.5's β anchor is the first lever that addressed this
mechanically rather than by choosing a corpus — it pulls the head back toward its pre-training self
in proportion to how well it is *already* accepting — and it is why that arm promoted when the four
loss-reweighting arms before it did not.

**The measurement protocol is part of the number.** τ is quoted as an **8-prompt suite mean at
NGEN0 ≥ 200** — past the drafter's 128-token sliding window. F92 measured τ at **1.39 over the first
32 generated tokens**, rising to ~3.2 only after ~128, so a short-generation acceptance figure is a
transient and is not comparable to anything, including this project's own earlier numbers.

**The single most important correction this project has made to its own model of itself:** the
long-quoted "19.0 tok/s AR roofline" is a *normalisation constant, not a target*. It assumes every
kernel moves bytes at full DRAM bandwidth and that the non-byte part of the step is zero. Neither
holds — 22.3 ms of a 71.4 ms step is not bytes at all, and the byte-moving marks average 191 GB/s,
not 233. See `wiki/measurement-and-traps.md`.

## The model

43 MoE backbone layers + 3 chained DSpark MTP blocks (layers 40/41/42, `mtp.0/1/2`). Hidden 4096,
64 heads × head_dim 512, Q-LoRA/O-LoRA rank 1024, 8 o-groups, 160 routed experts top-6 + 1 shared,
`moe_intermediate` 2048, hyper-connections ×4 with 20 Sinkhorn iterations, sliding window 128,
vocab 129280.

Quantisation **as shipped, never re-quantised**: MLA/dense FP8 e4m3 with F8_E8M0 128×128 block
scales; routed experts OCP MXFP4 (E2M1 + E8M0, block 32); norms/embed/lm_head/compressor/indexer
BF16. `B_tok` = **12.26 GB/token**.

## Hard constraints this repo operates under

- **No additional quantisation.** The checkpoint is used as shipped.
- **No invented model constants.** Every number traces to `config.json`, `REAP_MANIFEST.json` or
  `reap_plan.json`. This has been violated once — a head size copied from a *paper* about a
  different model — and the correction is recorded in `RESEARCH_LOG.md` §6(a).
- **Token ids come from the checkpoint's own tokenizer** (`tools/encode_prompt.py`, which gates
  itself on reproducing the canonical prompt). Inventing ids is the exact mistake the rule exists
  to stop.
- **Correctness gates before speed gates.** One change per measurement. Report bands, not points.
- **DSpark is not DFlash.** `~/gemma-cuda-hybrid` and `~/laguna-s1-cuda-server` are read-only
  references.

## Build and run

```bash
bash scripts/build_decode.sh                      # the engine
bash scripts/build_gate.sh                        # the unit gates

# the ONLY sanctioned launcher: enforces single-tenancy and detaches
scripts/run_model.sh <log> ./build/decode <ckpt> "0,671,6102,294,8760,344" 8
```

The six-id prompt is `BOS + "The capital of France is"` and the expected first decoded token is
`11111`. **Do not abbreviate it** — a truncated list still runs, still prints a tok/s, and silently
reports `GATE FAIL` against a different sequence.

Useful environment flags are catalogued in `LEVERS.md` §5. The two that matter most:
`MOE_MMA=1` (tensor-core MoE — right for prefill, **wrong for decode**) and `DSV4_DPROF=1`
(multi-level named GPU-phase timing, ~0.4 % overhead).

### The server (Phase 6)

```bash
bash scripts/build_server.sh    # gates, server, terminal client
bash scripts/serve.sh           # CPU gates as preflight, then listen on :8080
build/dsv4-chat                 # terminal client
                                # web UI at http://localhost:8080/
```

OpenAI-compatible: `/v1/chat/completions` (streaming and not), `/v1/completions`, `/v1/models`,
`/health`, `/metrics`. Tool calls, thinking blocks, and a KV prefix cache for agentic turns. One
binary, no Python on the request path. See **`SERVER.md`** for the surface, the gates and the
design decisions — in particular why the tokenizer is not gemma's and why the engine is a separate
translation unit from `src/decode.cu`.
