#   A. rope offset dropped (cosT/sinT not advanced by r0):  FAIL on BOTH GEMM settings,
#      130,624 of 1,048,576 floats differ, first at row 7 col 448.
#   B. GEMM pin dropped (delta goes back through fp8_block_gemm's M-dependent dispatch):
#      PASS at g_tc_fp8=0 -- the oracle really is M-independent -- and **FAIL at g_tc_fp8=1 with
#      377 of 1,048,576 floats differing at the last ulp** (0.209164858 vs 0.209164843).
# B is the one that justifies the gate's two design choices. 0.036 % of floats at the last ulp is
# exactly what a tolerance-based check calls "close enough", and it appears ONLY on the tensor-core
# path -- which is the path decode uses and the one a gate running only the default would skip.
#
# Both controls put the first differing float at col 448 = NOPE_DIM, and that is mechanism, not
# coincidence: act_quant_fp8sim re-quantises columns [0, NOPE_DIM) and absorbs sub-ulp differences,
