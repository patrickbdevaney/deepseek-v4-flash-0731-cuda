// dsv4_engine.h — the persistent serving engine: load once, serve many requests.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM src/decode.cu. decode.cu is the measurement harness that every
// finding in LOOP_LOG rests on -- its sweeps, probes and env knobs are the instrument, and
// refactoring an instrument invalidates the readings taken with it. So the engine is a NEW
// translation unit over the SAME kernels, carrying only the shipping configuration (block 6,
// adaptK 1.5, the s3 head, VKPLUS on) and none of the sweep machinery. tests/gate_engine.cu holds
// it to decode.cu's own output: same prompt, same tokens.
//
// WHAT IT ADDS THAT THE HARNESS HAS NO NEED FOR:
//   * a KV state that survives a request, so an agentic turn can reuse its prefix (Engine::extend)
//   * sampling (temperature / top-p / seed) instead of a hardwired argmax
//   * a token callback, so the server can stream
//
// SAMPLING AND SPECULATION ARE COMPATIBLE HERE, exactly. The verify accepts draft[i] iff it equals
// the token the TARGET produces at that position. Replacing "argmax of the target logits" with "a
// sample from the target logits" keeps that property: every emitted token is still drawn from the
// target's own conditional, so the output distribution is the model's. Speculation only decides how
// many positions get evaluated per forward, never which token is emitted. What it does cost is
// acceptance -- matching a random draw is strictly harder than matching an argmax -- so tok/s falls
// as temperature rises. That is a real tradeoff, not a bug, and it is measured, not assumed.

// Per-request speculation telemetry. `tok_per_verify` is one number summarising a chain of
// DEPENDENT events, and accept_profile.py's whole argument is that it hides the thing training
// moves: position j is only reached if 0..j-1 were all accepted, so the quantity that matters is
// the conditional hazard h(j) = P(accept j | reached j). Two heads with identical tau can have
// opposite h and respond to more training, and to a different adaptK, in opposite directions.
//
// h(j) is not recoverable from the two MARGINAL histograms (widths, accept lengths) -- it needs
// the joint, because a verify only reaches position j if its width offered a proposal there. So
// the joint is what is recorded. It is 16x16 ints = 1 KiB per request, incremented once per
// verify with no sync and no device memory, which is why this can be always-on where
