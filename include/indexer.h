// k_topk_decode / k_topk_verify / k_topk_masked in compressed_decode.cu). LOOP_LOG Finding 53.
//
// Every one of them declares `extern __shared__ float sh[]`, fills sh[0..n-1] and scans it with
// `for(t=0;t<n;++t)`, and every one of them was launched with exactly `n*sizeof(float)`. nvcc widens
// that scan into a 12-BYTE vectorised shared load, so any n < 3 reads past the allocation:
// compute-sanitizer reports "Invalid __shared__ read of size 12 bytes" and kills the launch, which
// the caller then reports as a fault on its own cudaStreamSynchronize line. Measured on this box
// (tests/gate_indexer_decode under memcheck): T=1 and T=2 fault, T>=3 are clean.
//
// n is a compressed-row count — 1..a few hundred — so rounding up costs nothing. `n+3` covers a
// 4-float load issued at the last element; the &~3 keeps the request 16-byte aligned.
// ---- warp argmax, the primitive behind the parallel top-k --------------------------------------
// The four top-k kernels used to open with `if(threadIdx.x||blockIdx.x) return;` and run an
// O(topk x T) selection sort on ONE thread of the 32 launched, on 1 of 20 SMs. At 24k context that
// is 512 x 6000 serial comparisons per ratio-4 layer, 21 layers, per target forward -- measured as
// the whole of the context-linear term in tools/decode_model.py's fit, and 14-28x slower than the
// same algorithm spread across the warp that was already there.
//
// TIE-BREAKING IS THE CORRECTNESS ARGUMENT. The serial scans ran ascending with a STRICT `>`, so
// equal scores resolved to the LOWEST index. This must reproduce that exactly: the selected set
// being right is not enough, because sparse_attn sums the selected rows IN ORDER and a reordering
// changes fp32 association. Callers therefore pass `T` (one past any valid index) as the "nothing
// found" sentinel rather than -1, so a lane that found nothing loses every comparison and lower
// indices win ties for free. Verified bit-identical against the originals on nine shapes and three
// distributions -- including one built entirely of exact ties -- by tests/gate_topk_warp.cu.

// ---- DECODE_LADDER item 1.4: dynamic shared memory above the 48 KiB default --------------------
//
// THE DEFECT, MEASURED ON THIS BOX rather than inferred. The four scan kernels above stage the
// whole score row in DYNAMIC shared memory, so they ask for ~4T bytes, and the per-block default is
// `cudaDevAttrMaxSharedMemoryPerBlock` = 49,152 B here -- the largest T that fits is 12,285,
// i.e. context 49,140 at ratio 4 (the sizer rounds up by up to 3 floats, so 12,288 is already over).
// One block above that:
//
//     T= 12288 smem= 49152  launch=cudaSuccess           sync=cudaSuccess  out=CORRECT
//     T= 16384 smem= 65536  launch=cudaErrorInvalidValue sync=cudaSuccess  out=UNTOUCHED
//
// Read the middle column. The LAUNCH fails, the following synchronize returns **success**, and the
// output buffer is left exactly as it was -- so the engine's own defences do not see it. `dprobe()`
// is compiled in but inert unless `DSV4_SYNCPROBE` is set; `dsync()` does check the error slot but
// only *warns* unless `DSV4_STRICT_LAUNCH` is set, and the arena path skips its sync entirely.
//
// WHAT THE CONSUMER THEN READS WAS MEASURED, not assumed, by driving the engine's own decode entry
// point at context 49,207 with the fix switched off (tests/gate_topk_smem_ctx.cu, ladder 1.4's
// engine-path leg). `dtop` in `compressed_decode_step_indexer` comes from `dmalloc`, which is a bump
// allocator and does NOT zero -- so this is not "attends to row 0 forever", it is worse: the step
// completes, `cudaDeviceSynchronize` returns success, the process exits 0, and `out` is 4096/4096
// nonzero with no NaN and a different hash from the correct answer. A wrong answer wearing the
// costume of a right one.
//
// THE FIX IS THE OPT-IN, AND WHERE THE OPT-IN RUNS OUT IT IS AN ABORT. `cudaFuncSetAttribute` with
// `cudaFuncAttributeMaxDynamicSharedMemorySize` raises the ceiling to
// `cudaDevAttrMaxSharedMemoryPerBlockOptin` = 232,448 B here: T = 58,112, context 232,448, a 4.7x
// headroom increase. Above THAT there is no opt-in on any device, so this aborts with the numbers
// instead of returning a size that will fail silently. An abort is the correct outcome: the
// alternative is not "slower", it is "wrong answers that look like answers".
//
// COST IS ZERO IN THE REGIME THE ENGINE ACTUALLY RUNS IN. The request is compared against the
// default limit first and returns immediately when it fits, so at `seqmax` 16,384 (T = 4,096,
// 16 KiB) not one CUDA call is added. Above the default it is one `cudaFuncSetAttribute` per
// kernel for the lifetime of the process -- the attribute is a MAXIMUM, so it is set once to this
// kernel's ceiling and never touched again. That matters because these kernels ARE the
// `DSV4_TOPK_RADIX=0` A/B arm: adding a per-launch host call to them would inflate every future
// re-measurement of 1.2.
//
// WHY OPT IN RATHER THAN DELETE. The shipped path (item 1.2's radix select) requests zero dynamic
// shared memory and cannot hit this at any T, so deleting these four kernels would also close the
// item. It would also delete the `DSV4_TOPK_RADIX=0` comparison arm and the `DSV4_TOPK_GATE=1`
// in-situ bit-exactness reference -- the only thing in this repo that can prove a future top-k
// change still matches the original selection sort. The reference is worth more than the twelve
// lines it costs to keep it correct.
//
// THE KILL-SWITCH IS WHAT MAKES THIS ITEM MEASURABLE, and it is the reason it is here at all.
// `DSV4_TOPK_SMEM_OPTIN=0` restores the EXACT pre-1.4 behaviour in the same binary: no
// `cudaFuncSetAttribute`, no post-launch error check, the size handed back regardless. Without it,
// "the fix works" is a claim about a binary that no longer exists, and the before-arm would have to
// be a git checkout, a rebuild, and a different set of everything-else. With it, before and after
// are two runs of one executable over one input, which is the only form of before/after this ladder
// accepts. It is deliberately loud: restoring a silent-garbage path prints that it did so, every
// time, so a switch left set in a script cannot masquerade as a passing run. Default is ON.
